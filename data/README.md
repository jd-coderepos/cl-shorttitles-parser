# Data for the Title Parser

### About

The file `acl-titles.dat` is an example input file that can be used to test the parser.

The folder `output` has the program output for the above input file.

Alternatively, a more updated version of the `acl-titles.dat` can be recreated by downloading the original data from the ACL anthology. For more information, please see this [README](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/cl-titles-parser/tree/master/data#readme).
